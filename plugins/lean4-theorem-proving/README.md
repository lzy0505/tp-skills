# lean4-theorem-proving

Systematic workflows for Lean 4 proof development.

## Overview

This skill teaches Claude how to develop formal proofs in Lean 4 using battle-tested workflows from real formalization projects. It provides systematic approaches, automation tools, and domain-specific patterns for measure theory, probability, and algebra.

## What You Get

### 4-Phase Proof Development Workflow

1. **Structure Before Solving** - Outline proof strategy before writing tactics
2. **Helper Lemmas First** - Build infrastructure bottom-up
3. **Incremental Filling** - One `sorry` at a time, compile, commit, repeat
4. **Type Class Management** - Explicit instance handling for sub-structures

### 16 Automation Scripts

**Search (4 scripts):**
- `search_mathlib.sh` - Find lemmas in mathlib by name, type, or content
- `smart_search.sh` - Multi-source search (mathlib + APIs)
- `find_instances.sh` - Locate type class instances
- `find_usages.sh` - Track theorem usage across project

**Analysis (4 scripts):**
- `proof_complexity.sh` - Analyze proof metrics (lines, tactics, tokens)
- `dependency_graph.sh` - Visualize theorem dependencies
- `build_profile.sh` - Profile build performance and bottlenecks
- `suggest_tactics.sh` - Get tactic suggestions for goals

**Verification (4 scripts):**
- `sorry_analyzer.py` - Extract and track sorries with context
- `check_axioms.sh` - Verify axiom usage (external import method)
- `check_axioms_inline.sh` - Verify axiom usage (inline method)
- `simp_lemma_tester.sh` - Test `@[simp]` lemmas for issues

**Quality & Refactoring (4 scripts):**
- `pre_commit_hook.sh` - Comprehensive quality gates
- `unused_declarations.sh` - Find dead code
- `minimize_imports.py` - Remove unused imports
- `proof_templates.sh` - Generate proof skeletons

## Installation

See [INSTALLATION.md](../INSTALLATION.md) for installation instructions.

## Usage

### Automatic Activation

Claude automatically uses this skill when you:
- Work on `.lean` files
- Mention Lean 4, theorem proving, or formal verification
- Prove theorems or manage sorries/axioms
- Ask about mathlib or type class issues

No manual invocation needed!

### Key Principles

- ✅ **Always compile before commit** (`lake build` is your test suite)
- ✅ **Document every sorry** with strategy and dependencies
- ✅ **Search mathlib first** before reproving standard results
- ✅ **Eliminate axioms systematically** with documented plans
- ✅ **One change at a time** - fill one sorry, compile, commit

### Slash Commands

Interactive workflows you can invoke by typing `/lean` in Claude Code (autocomplete will show available commands).

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/lean4-theorem-proving:search-mathlib [query]` | Find mathlib lemmas before proving |
| `/lean4-theorem-proving:analyze-sorries` | Scan project for incomplete proofs |
| `/lean4-theorem-proving:fill-sorry [file:line]` | Get interactive help filling a sorry |
| `/lean4-theorem-proving:check-axioms [file]` | Verify axiom hygiene |
| `/lean4-theorem-proving:build-lean` | Build with formatted error analysis |
| `/lean4-theorem-proving:golf-proofs [file]` | Optimize proofs (30-40% reduction) |
| `/lean4-theorem-proving:clean-warnings` | Clean linter warnings by category |

### Common Patterns

**Integrability proofs:**
```lean
have h_integrable : Integrable X μ := by
  refine ⟨h_measurable, ?_⟩
  calc ∫⁻ a, ‖X a‖₊ ∂μ
    ≤ ∫⁻ a, M ∂μ := by apply lintegral_mono; intro; apply h_bound
    _ = M * μ univ := lintegral_const M
    _ < ∞ := by simp [h_prob, ENNReal.mul_lt_top]
```

**Conditional expectation equalities:**
```lean
theorem condExp_unique (hX : Measurable X) (hY : Measurable Y)
    (h_eq : ∀ s, MeasurableSet[m] s → ∫ x in s, X x ∂μ = ∫ x in s, Y x ∂μ) :
    condExp μ m X =ᵐ[μ] Y := by
  apply ae_eq_condExp_of_forall_setIntegral_eq hX hY
  exact h_eq
```

**Type class instance management:**
```lean
-- Explicit instance when Lean can't infer
haveI : MeasurableSpace Ω := inferInstance
haveI : IsProbabilityMeasure μ := h_prob

-- Now use dependent results
apply measure_eq_on_generateFrom
```

## When to Use

**Perfect for:**
- Formalizing mathematical theorems (analysis, algebra, topology)
- Working with measure theory and probability
- Contributing to mathlib
- Managing complex proof development
- Converting axioms to proven lemmas
- Dealing with type class inference issues

**Especially helpful when:**
- Starting a new Lean formalization project
- Learning Lean 4 from Lean 3 or other proof assistants
- Stuck with type class synthesis errors
- Managing multiple interrelated proofs
- Working on real analysis, probability, or abstract algebra

## Examples from Real Projects

This skill was developed from real-world Lean 4 formalization work:

**Project:** de Finetti theorem formalization (1000+ commits, 22 files)

**Patterns extracted:**
- π-system uniqueness for measure equality
- Conditional expectation via integral identity
- Type class instance management for sub-σ-algebras
- Systematic axiom elimination (75 axioms → 6 sorries → 0)

**Scripts validated on:**
- Exchangeability formalization
- All 16 scripts tested on real codebase
- See [scripts/TESTING.md](scripts/TESTING.md) for validation report

## Requirements

- **Claude Code 2.0.13+** (for marketplace installation), OR
- **Claude.ai Pro/Max/Team/Enterprise** (for web/API), OR
- **Just Claude** (for CLAUDE.md method)
- (Optional) Lean 4 installed for working on Lean projects

## FAQ

### How does this work with the lean4-memories plugin?

The **lean4-memories plugin** (experimental) provides a skill that adds persistent learning across sessions using MCP memory server integration. This skill (lean4-theorem-proving) works standalone and provides all core functionality.

**Use together:**
- lean4-theorem-proving provides general workflows and patterns
- lean4-memories adds project-specific context that persists across sessions
- Example: lean4-memories can remember "in this project, we always use π-system arguments for measure equality"

See [lean4-memories/README.md](../lean4-memories/README.md) for details.

### How does this work with the lean4-subagents plugin?

The **lean4-subagents plugin** (experimental) provides three specialized subagents for automating mechanical Lean 4 tasks:

**Specialized subagents:**
- `lean4-proof-golfer` - Systematically optimize proofs (works with `/golf-proofs`)
- `lean4-sorry-filler` - Fill sorries using mathlib search (works with `/fill-sorry`)
- `lean4-axiom-eliminator` - Eliminate axioms systematically (works with `/check-axioms`)

**Use together:**
- lean4-theorem-proving provides workflows and slash commands
- lean4-subagents provides autonomous agents that execute those workflows in batch
- Example: "Dispatch lean4-sorry-filler to fill all 15 sorries in this file"

This skill works standalone. lean4-subagents is optional for batch automation.

See [subagent-workflows.md](skills/lean4-theorem-proving/references/subagent-workflows.md) for delegation patterns.

### Do I need all 16 scripts?

No! Scripts are organized by use case:
- **Daily use:** search_mathlib.sh, sorry_analyzer.py, suggest_tactics.sh
- **Quality gates:** pre_commit_hook.sh, check_axioms_inline.sh
- **Specific tasks:** All others (use as needed)

### Can I use just the SKILL.md without scripts?

Yes! The SKILL.md provides the core workflow. Scripts are optional automation tools.

### How is this different from Claude's general Lean knowledge?

Claude has general Lean knowledge from training. This skill provides:
- **Specific workflows** (structure before solve, one sorry at a time)
- **Project patterns** (type class management, mathlib integration)
- **Quality standards** (compile before commit, document sorries)
- **Automation tools** (16 scripts for common tasks)

It's like having a Lean 4 expert mentor coaching Claude.

## Technical Details

### Bootstrap Hook

This plugin includes a `SessionStart` hook (`hooks/bootstrap.sh`) that runs once when Claude Code starts.

**What it does:**
1. Finds Python interpreter (`python3` or `python`)
2. Copies 8 tool scripts to `.claude/tools/lean4/` in your workspace
3. Sets environment variables for the session

**Why this is safe:**
- Read-only operations (only copies files, doesn't modify your code)
- Runs in sandboxed environment
- Only copies known tool scripts (no arbitrary code execution)
- Fails gracefully if Python is not installed
- No network access, no file modification, no git operations

**Scripts staged to `.claude/tools/lean4/`:**
`sorry_analyzer.py`, `search_mathlib.sh`, `smart_search.sh`, `check_axioms.sh`, `find_golfable.py`, `analyze_let_usage.py`, `count_tokens.py`, `suggest_tactics.sh`

This staging approach allows slash commands to reference scripts reliably without triggering Claude Code's parameter substitution security filter.
